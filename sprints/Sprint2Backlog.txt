June 14 to June 19

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) The user can traverse through nested directories using the “cd” 
   command and a given directory “DIR” i.e. cd DIR. Instead of a 
   directory the user can pass through “..” which represents the 
   parent directory or “.” which represent the current directory
b) The user can print a file or multiple files onto the shell using
   the “cat” or “ls” command and given file names “FILE1 FILE2 …” 		
   i.e. cat FILE1 i.e. ls FILE1 FILE2 
c) The user can print the contents of the directory using the “ls”  
   command and a valid path “PATH”. i.e. ls PATH … The user 
   is given a error message if an invalid path is given.
d) The user can display the whole path of the current directory 
   using the “pwd” command
e) The user can save the current working directory using the 		
   “pushd DIR” (where DIR is a specified directory) command 
   and  change to the specified DIR as the working directory. 
   The saved old current directory can be returned to at any 
   time.
f) The user can remove the last saved directory using the “popd”
   command and makes it the current working directory. If there 
   is no saved directory an appropriate error message will be 
   displayed.
g) The user can use the “man” command to get a description of
   another specific command “CMD” i.e. man CMD
h) The user can use the “echo” command with “>> OUTFILE” to modify		
   the outfile such that it appends an extra string line “STRING” to 
   the end of the file. i.e. echo STRING >> OUTFILE
i) The user should be able to create and store text in the form of a file,
   and should be able to display the contents
j) The user enters a command and the proper command is ensured to run
