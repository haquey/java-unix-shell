User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) If the user specifies a “-R” parameter with the “ls” command, the
   program will display all subdirectories of the specified path on
   the Shell.
b) The user can move a file from a specified OLDPATH to a NEWPATH
   by using the “mv” command. The specified paths may be relative
   to the current directory or full paths. User is given an error if
   an invalid directory path is given
c) The user should be able to copy files or directories from one
   location OLDPATH into another NEWPATH, using “cp”
   (while keeping the original intact)
d) The user can use the “curl” command to get file containing all the
   String texts found on the “URL” provided to the command
   i.e. curl URL
e) The user can print any lines containing a given regex in a file
   (path) using the “grep” command i.e. grep REGEX PATH
f) The user can check all lines in all files that contain a given
   regex and prints the file name, file location and the lines that
   contain the given regex i.e. grep -R REGEX PATH
g) The user can use the “man” command to get a description of
   another specific command “CMD” i.e. man CMD
h) The user can take any command and add the “> OUTFILE” to
   create a file whose contents are overwritten with the specified 
   command’s output. Adding the “>> OUTFILE” will create a file whose
   contents are appended with the specified command’s output.
   i.e. pwd > OUTFILE
i) The user can recall any particular previous input by its number.
   i.e. "!3" would give the third input the user had inserted while
   running the program.
