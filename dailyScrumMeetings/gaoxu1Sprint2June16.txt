a) What did I work on last time?
	Completed File class
	Discussed implementations of EchoAppend and EchoOverride with FileSystem
	and cd with teammates
	Started implementing EchoAppend and EchoOverride
	Helped teammates find logical errors in their code	
	
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	I will start implementing pwd and cd classes
	I will continue testing others' codes to make sure we're continuously on 
	track
	I will continue implementing two echo classes
	I will complete output once history and other classes are complete

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	I am stuck on the implementation of Output until history and other classes
	that ouputs information are complete.
	I am stuck on how mkdir does not use cd to traverse through folders to make
	a folder
