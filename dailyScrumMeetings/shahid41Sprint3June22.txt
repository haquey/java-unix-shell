a) What did I work on last time?
 - Updated DirStack to new implementation as discussed by group
 - Finished classes PushD and PopD
 - Assisted in modifying the JShell

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - I will complete the Man class using an interface
 - Testing for all classes
 - Further discuss the dirstack and pushD and popD implementation
 	as I don't think they are the best at the moment as decided by the group

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - I hope to find a better way to implement the pushD and popD classes using
 	the interface
