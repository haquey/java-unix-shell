
a) What did I work on last time?
	- Completely redesigned and implemented ProQuery based on new knowledge
	  acquired from tutorial this week
	- Created a CommandInterface class and restructured code
	- Fixed CRC cards to represent new design
	- Made ProQuery collaborate with numerous command classes
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Continue working on ProQuery and making sure that it functions properly
	  with all command classes and different test cases
	- Create new Echo class to collaborate with ProQuery
	- Make ProQuery collaborate with a DirStack
	- Give ProQuery special cases for working with PushD and PopD commands

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- DirStack and PushD/PopD must be functioning properly for it to
	  successfully collaborate with the ProQuery
