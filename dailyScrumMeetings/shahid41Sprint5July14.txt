a) What did I work on last time?
	- Completed the grep command
	- Added some more tests for the grep command
	- Updated the !Number command

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Edit grep for error handling
	- Edit !Number for error handling
	- Make some error classes
	- Update all classes so they now return a string (new implementation)
	- Update history class so that it doesn't use internals in its methods

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Am encountering some trouble doing error handling
