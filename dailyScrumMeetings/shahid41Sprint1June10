a) What did I work on last time?
 - Discussed design aspects for the assignment with group
 - Discussed implementation for majority of the classes
 - Created many crc cards with the previous implementation of both groups

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - Start on the Input and History class
 - Discuss implementation on current and any possible new classes with the group

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - No as both the Input class will be able to work independently with
 	respect to behaviour and implementation and the history class will
 	only need the Input class to test things
 - To test if the Input class has appropriate functionality, the validator class
 	will be needed
