
a) What did I work on last time?
	- Completed Validator class
	- Casually tested Validator class
	- Created/fixed crc cards 

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Start and potentially finish the following class methods:
	  - proQuery
	  - file
	  - man
	  - cat
	- Will edit and create crc cards as needed if any changes to the design
	  occur
	- Complete the toString methods in each command class to complete the
	  'man' command class

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Will have to employ mock testing to test the proQuery class which
	  collaborates with all the command classes
