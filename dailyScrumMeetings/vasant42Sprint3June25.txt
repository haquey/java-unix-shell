a) What did I work on last time?
 - Completely finished LS and Mkdir; removed all bugs; added all functionality
 - Tested using informal test cases
 - Changed the implementation of JFileSystem into an interface which uses a 
   tree like system for Files/Folders

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - Create test cases for JFileSystem

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - Unsure of how to test classes that return nothing vs ones that do
