
a) What did I work on last time?
	- Designed/planned implementation for ProQuery class and started it

	- Designed/planned implementation for Man class and started it
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Commit completed code for Cat, Man and ProQuery classes
	- Fix toString methods for all command classes so that they contain
	  their respective documentation/instructions for the man class/command
	  to make use of

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Command classes should all be made so that I can change their all of
	  their respective toString methods (i.e. CD)
