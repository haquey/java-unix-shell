
a) What did I work on last time?
	- Almost complete implementing ProQuery class
	- Almost complete implementing Man class
	- Continued working on Cat class
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Commit completed code for Cat, Man and ProQuery classes
	- Test classes using java unit testing after code completion

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need to discuss design implementation of command classes with group so
	  that I can progress on ProQuery class. Need to find out how to interface
	  with the other classes.
