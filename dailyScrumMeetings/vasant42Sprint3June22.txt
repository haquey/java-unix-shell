a) What did I work on last time?
 - Tested Mkdir and LS against Proquery
 - Found a few bugs, some of which have already been fixed
 - Added some bits of functionality to Mkdir and LS (like working with files
   and working with paths with a "/" at the end)

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - Fix all bugs in LS and Mkdir
 - Change the implementation of the hierarchy of the folders slightly
 - Try to shift through and remove redundant code after implementation is 
   changed

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - No not at the moment
