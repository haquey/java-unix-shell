a) What did I work on last time?
 - Finished DirStack
 - Began PushD and PopD but could not move forward because classes needed
 	to be finished

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - Now that the classes needed for PushD and PopD are completed, I will finish
 	the two classes
 - Update the driver/JShell as new classes are made
 - Begin testing on some classes (History, DirStack)

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - Cannot do anything with JShell until ProQuery is completed
 - PushD and PopD cannot be completed until the final adjustments to CD
 	are made
