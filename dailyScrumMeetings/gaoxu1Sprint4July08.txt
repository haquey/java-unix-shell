a) What did I work on last time?
	created new OutputToFile class that would take an output and send it
	to a file given the proper parameters
	Documented OutputToFile class so everyone can implement the class into
	their commands
	Started discussing with team reassessing the roles of each team mate
	Started implementing changes to older classes such as cat, echo, PWD
	
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	I will continue changing my older classes to meet the new requirements
	I will continue discussing with my team how my new commands will 
	collaborate	with the current fileSystem
	I will start creating new code once I am done revising my old commands

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	I am not blocked on anything
