a) What did I work on last time?
 - Created the JShell, or, before the name change, the "Input" class
 	this is still incomplete as other classes need to be made to complete it
 - Completed the History class

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - Continue updating the JShell as new classes are made
 - Modify crcCards as we go as the implementation of the JShell is not entirely
 	decided upon
 - Create the DirStack class
 - Create the PopD class
 - Create the PushD class

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - I will be unable to complete the JShell until classes are made, we as a
 	group must still discuss the implementation of it
