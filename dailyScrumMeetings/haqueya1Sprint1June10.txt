
a) What did I work on last time?
	- Discussed/argued JShell design aspects for the assignment
	- Discussed implementation details for certain classes
	- Created numerous crc cards 

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Start and potentially finish the Validator class
	- Discuss further implementation details for other classes with the group

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not at the moment as the Validator class works pretty independently
	  in terms of behaviour and implementation.
	- Might need the input, output and jshell classes to be started to help
	  test the validator class
