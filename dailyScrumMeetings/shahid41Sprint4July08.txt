a) What did I work on last time?
	- Committed the crc cards for the !Number and grep command classes
	- Updated ProQuery to be able to get the history
	- Updated the product backlog as it was missing a user story
	- Made a rough copy of the !Number command class

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	- Update the Number class and do the testing for the class

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- Waiting until lessons on regex to create the grep command
