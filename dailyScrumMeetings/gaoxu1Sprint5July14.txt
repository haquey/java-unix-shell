a) What did I work on last time?
	Corrected OutputToFile class so that it can traverse through paths
	Corrected my old commands (CD, PWD, CAT) to include redirecting output
	and return a string in execute command
	Started on Curl command
	
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	I will start creating unit tests for OutputToFile class and older
	classes with string being returned
	I will start implementing redirection of output to all other commands
	I will continue coding curl command

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	I am not blocked on anything
