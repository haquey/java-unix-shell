a) What did I work on last time?
 - Began LS, was not able to finish
 - LS can now display the contents of the current working directory
 - Thought of the implementation of LS
 - Added some more functionality to Folder and Filesystem class

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - I will attempt to finish the majority of LS class
 - I discovered that I missed some functionality for Mkdir class that must be 
   added

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - I am a little confused as to the capabilities of LS and what to do for 
   certain arguments; will ask on piazza for clarification
 - Still a little unclear of how to work with relative paths; will attempt to
   think through it logical and find a solution before the commencement of the 
   final sprint
