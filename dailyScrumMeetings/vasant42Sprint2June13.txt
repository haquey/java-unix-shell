a) What did I work on last time?
 - Implemented and finished Filesystem
 - Ended up having to also create Mkdir to ensure my implementation would work
 - Also created Folder class to test Mkdir and Filesystem

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
 - Start and (will try to finish) the LS class
 - Test Mkdir, Filesystem, and folder once the other nessesacry commands are
   finished.
 - Add 1 more responsibility to Mkdir (multiple simultaneous creation)

c) Am I blocked on anything?
 - Not at the moment, if anything comes up I will be sure to ask my group
   for advice
